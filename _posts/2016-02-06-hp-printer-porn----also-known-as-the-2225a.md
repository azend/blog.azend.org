Here's yet another reason to always know the person who takes out your garbage. An original Hewlett-Packard ThinkJet 2225A straight out of 1984. This ought to be in a museum. And the best part? Staples still sells brand new ink cartridges for these printers.

Some friends of mine and I are planning on taking this printer and restoring it back to its original printing self. With HP-IB as the only interface, it's going to take some thinking to turn this into a regular usb printer.
